## Lambdas

Kotlin supports a functional style of programming.
Read about [higher-order functions and function literals (lambdas)](lambdas) in Kotlin.

Pass a lambda to [`any`](any)
function to check if the collection contains an even number.
The function `any` gets a predicate as an argument and returns true if there is at least one element satisfying the predicate.
