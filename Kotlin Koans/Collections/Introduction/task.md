## Introduction

This part was inspired by [GS Collections Kata](https://github.com/goldmansachs/gs-collections-kata).

Default collections in Kotlin are Java collections,
but there are lots of useful extension functions for them.
For example, operations that transform a collection to another one, starting with 'to':
[`toSet`](http://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/to-set.html) or
[`toList`](http://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/to-list.html).

Implement an extension function `Shop.getSetOfCustomers()`.
The class `Shop` and all related classes can be found at [Shop.kt](/#/Kotlin%20Koans/Collections/Introduction/Shop.kt).
